# Divyansh — Web Developer (Frontend / JavaScript)

Hi — I'm **Divyansh**.
I'm a budding web developer focusing on frontend and JavaScript.  
Welcome to my project collection — here you'll find small interactive apps that show my current skills and the places I'm growing.

## About Me
- Student of Computer Science (CSE).  
- Building interactive web apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- I like making small projects to learn core JS concepts: DOM manipulation, events, timer logic, basic game logic, and UI updates.

## JavaScript Skills (What I can show right now)
- **Core JavaScript**: variables, functions, control flow, arrays, objects  
- **DOM Manipulation**: selecting elements, updating content, handling user input and events  
- **Browser APIs & Timing**: setInterval, setTimeout, event listeners for UI controls  
- **ES6+ Features**: let/const, arrow functions, template literals (where appropriate)  
- **Game & UI Logic**: scoring, simple game rules, input validation  
- **Project Structure**: separating HTML/CSS/JS files so projects are easy to extend
